# ABC

Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ABC codebase. This is a practice project.

## Tech Stuff

[React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end magic. Animations are sprinkled in with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and the styles are brought to you by the tag team duo of regular CSS and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Project Structure

Let's peek at the folders and files:

-   **src**: The heart of the code.
    -   **assets**: Home to images and icons that make things pretty.
    -   **components**: The actors in our React drama, like Home section, Features section, and friends.
    -   **shared**: Components that get invited to multiple sections' parties (like the Banner and Footer).
    -   **variants.js**: Framer Motion dance routines go here.

## Stars of the Show

### Navbar

The navigation maestro. It directs the show with the site logo, navigation links, language options, and a signup button.

### Home

The main stage where the spotlight shines bright. It's the landing page with a banner inviting everyone to get started.

### Features

A star-studded section showcasing why ABC is the coolest. Framer Motion takes care of the animated moves.

### About

A chill section with two parts, each with an image and some random content. It talks about the platform's made-up history and mission.

### Pricing

A price-list spectacle displaying different plans. You can toggle between monthly and yearly billing. Expect smooth animations thanks to Framer Motion and TailwindCSS!

### Newsletter

A curtain call encouraging users to share made-up discount codes. It uses the Banner component from the shared folder.

### Footer

The after-party section with company gibberish, contact nonsense, and links to nowhere in particular.
